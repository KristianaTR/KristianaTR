### Hi there 👋 
### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋 
I'm Kristiana, a passionate developer 😁 exploring the vast realms of coding. 
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, spanning from beginner-friendly tasks to more intricate undertakings.
In this repository, I've stored all my projects throughout my coding journey, including:
💫 Coding classes
💫 Mentorship tasks
💫 Learning projects
💫 Bootcamps
💫 Internship experiences
  
As they say, "From zero to hero 🦸‍♀️." 
In some sense, I feel like a hero, but honestly, I still need to work hard to reach that stage 🌟.
